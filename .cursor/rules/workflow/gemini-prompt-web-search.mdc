# Gemini Prompts — Web Search and Context

## 1. Gemini has no project context

**Gemini does not have access to this project.** It cannot see the repository, open files, Cursor rules, or any project-specific context.

When you **write or create a prompt for Gemini** (or content meant to be used in Gemini):

- **Assume zero project context:** Assume Gemini cannot see this codebase, `.cursorrules`, or `.cursor/rules/`.
- **Make the prompt self-contained:** Either embed in the prompt all information Gemini needs (relevant code snippets, file paths, constraints, or specs), or explicitly tell the user to paste that context into the same or a follow-up message.
- **Avoid references that only work in Cursor:** Do not say things like "see the open file" or "as in our rules"; include the actual content or tell the user to paste it.

## 2. Web search: always required

When the user asks you to **write**, **create**, or **draft a prompt for Gemini** (or any prompt intended to be used with Gemini), the generated prompt **must** instruct Gemini to **always perform web search** (not only "when appropriate" or "when needed"). The instruction should make web search a required part of Gemini's process for that task.

## What to add

Include one of the following (or equivalent) in the prompt you produce:

- "Always use web search (e.g. Google Search) before or while answering; do not rely only on your training data."
- "You must perform web search to look up current or factual information as part of answering this request."
- "Use web search for this task. Do not skip web search; include it as a step in your process."

Avoid wording that makes web search optional (e.g. "when needed", "if relevant", "when appropriate"). The prompt should require Gemini to actually perform web search for the user's request.

Place this instruction in a visible place in the prompt (e.g. at the start under "Instructions" or in a "Guidelines" section).

## 3. Reply format: prompt only

When you **deliver** a Gemini prompt to the user (in reply to a request to write or create a prompt for Gemini), your reply must contain **only** the content intended to be pasted directly into Gemini.

- **No wrapper text:** Do not add introductory or closing phrases such as "Use this prompt:", "Paste the following into Gemini:", "Copy the block below:", or similar.
- **No extra markdown or separators** whose sole purpose is to frame the prompt (e.g. avoid a line of "---" or "Paste the whole block below" after the prompt).
- **Output = the prompt itself:** The user should be able to select all of your reply and paste it straight into Gemini with no editing. If you need a minimal separator (e.g. to distinguish code from prose inside the prompt), keep it part of the prompt content that Gemini will see, not as Cursor-side instructions to the user.

## Scope

These rules apply when the user explicitly asks you to **write** or **create** a prompt **for Gemini** (or for use with Gemini). They do not apply to general Cursor instructions or to prompts for other tools unless the user specifies the same requirement.
