# No Cursor Attribution in PR / Commits

**Do not include "Made with Cursor" or any Cursor branding in content that is committed or submitted to the repo.**

## Applies to

- **PR title and body**: Do not add "Made with Cursor", Cursor links, or similar attribution in pull request descriptions or titles.
- **Commit messages**: Do not add Cursor attribution in commit subject, body, or footer.
- **Code and docs**: Do not add "Made with Cursor" (or similar) in comments, README, or any file that would be part of a PR.

## Rule

When generating or suggesting text for PRs, commits, or repo-facing content, omit any line or block that promotes or attributes the content to Cursor (e.g. "Made with Cursor", Cursor badges, or Cursor marketing links). Keep content professional and tool-agnostic.
