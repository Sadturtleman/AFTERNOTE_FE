# Project Context & Rules

**CLAUDE.md is kept in sync by the AI whenever Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules`) are added, removed, or renamed. Do not edit this file manually.**

This file uses Claude Code's `@` import syntax to reference Cursor rule files.
Claude Code will automatically load the referenced files when this project is opened.

## How This Works

Claude Code uses the `@` syntax to import file contents. When you open this project in Claude Code, it will:

1. Read this `CLAUDE.md` file
2. Automatically import all referenced rule files
3. Load their contents into the context

This allows Cursor and Claude Code to share the same rule files without duplication or synchronization issues.
