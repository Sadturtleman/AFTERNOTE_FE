# Project Context & Rules

**⚠️ WARNING: This file is auto-generated. Do not edit manually.**
**To update rules, edit `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.**

This file uses Claude Code's `@` import syntax to reference Cursor rule files.
Claude Code will automatically load the referenced files when this project is opened.

## How This Works

Claude Code uses the `@` syntax to import file contents. When you open this project in Claude Code, it will:

1. Read this `CLAUDE.md` file
2. Automatically import all files referenced with `@`
3. Load their contents into the context

This allows Cursor and Claude Code to share the same rule files without duplication or synchronization issues.
