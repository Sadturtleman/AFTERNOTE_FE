# ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES SUMMARY - READ FIRST

**This section contains the core rules that AI must recognize first. For detailed explanations, refer to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.**

# GIT PROTOCOL - STRICT ENFORCEMENT (Highest Priority)
</critical_instruction>

## MUST DO
1. **Git**:
   - **Verification**: Before push command, **must first verify** that current branch is not `main`/`develop`
   - **Commitlint**: 커밋 메시지의 모든 줄(subject, body, footer)은 **100자 이내**. 긴 내용은 줄바꿈으로 분리
2. **Branch (Recommended)**: Prefer using an appropriate branch (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, etc.)
3. **Branch Cleanup**: After a successful merge to `main`, delete merged branches
   - **Local**: Delete branches that are merged into `main` (excluding `main`/`develop`/`master`)
4. **Preview**: All public Composables must have `@Preview`. Screens using `hiltViewModel()` must use a ViewModel contract + Fake in Preview (see compose.mdc) so Previews render without Hilt.
7. **Modifier**: If a Composable has a modifier parameter, it should be placed first.
8. **State**: State hoisting to caller, Stateless composable preferred
   - **Complete State Hoisting**: All screen states (tabs, navigation items, etc.) must move to ViewModel
9. **Architecture**: Presentation → Domain ← Data (strict layer separation)
11. **ViewModel Injection**: `@HiltViewModel` uses `hiltViewModel()`, regular ViewModel uses `viewModel()`
12. **StateFlow Collection**: Use `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` (never use `collectAsState()`)
13. **`.cursorrules` Management**: If this file exceeds 300 lines, consider splitting or keeping only core rules
15. **HTTP Status Code Tests Required**: ViewModels that call APIs must include HTTP error tests
    - 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error
    - Network Error (IOException)
    - See `.cursor/rules/quality/code-quality.mdc` for details
16. **Required checks**: Code must pass commitlint, ktlint, and build checks before merge (see `.cursor/rules/workflow/pr-ci-checks.mdc`)

## MUST NOT DO
2. **Hand off instead of doing**: When the user asks you to do something (create PR, run command, apply change), do not respond with only instructions or content for the user to do it. Perform the action yourself when possible (e.g. run `gh pr create`, run gradle, edit files). Fall back to instructions only when execution is not possible (e.g. tool not available, auth failed).
3. `android.R` import
4. Wildcard imports (`import foo.*`)
5. Android/Data dependencies in Domain Layer
8. **File Modification in Ask Mode**: In Ask mode, STRICTLY ANSWER ONLY. Do not attempt file modification. Interpret questions as pure curiosity, not criticism or modification requests.
9. **ViewModel Injection Confusion**: Never use `viewModel()` for `@HiltViewModel` (runtime error)
10. **Non Lifecycle-aware State Collection**: Never use `collectAsState()` (memory leak risk)
11. **Local State Management**: Never manage screen state with `remember { mutableStateOf() }` inside Composable (move to ViewModel)

## CRITICAL PATTERNS
- **Figma parity**: Hardcoded `dp` values are allowed in UI to quickly verify margins match Figma.
 Avoid creating “new” values via meaningless arithmetic (e.g. `16.dp - 8.dp`).
- **Named Arguments Pattern**: Use explicit parameter names for readability and safety. Use `FontWeight.Medium` instead of `FontWeight(500)`. 
- **Rem-based Design**: REM 구현 시 **weight 우선** — 큰 간격(24dp+)은 `Spacer(Modifier.weight(ratio))` 또는 `Arrangement` 사용. 스크롤 내부일 때만 `BoxWithConstraints`. 작은 간격(≤8dp)은 `Spacer`, 컴포넌트 크기는 고정 dp
- **Maximize Core Component Reuse**: Maximize reuse of common components in `core` module (`Header`, `LabeledTextField`, `MessageTextField`, `CustomRadioButton`, etc.)
- **Component Overloading**: When overall structure is similar but details differ, use **overloading** instead of separate components
- **Component Reuse**: If uncertain, use `private` function; if reuse confirmed, separate file
- **File Limit**: Split if exceeds 400 lines, maintain 10-15 files per folder
- **`.cursorrules` Optimization**: Recommend ≤300 lines, consider splitting to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` if exceeded
- **Tests**: Check/add tests when UseCase/ViewModel changes
- **Parameter Refactoring Pattern**: When 10+ parameters needed, don't just wrap in data class, apply **section-based grouping** pattern
- **State Holder Pattern for Cognitive Complexity**: Must apply **State Holder pattern** to keep SonarQube cognitive complexity ≤15. No lambda definitions inside Composable, all logic moves to State class
- **Slot API Pattern (Composition over Inheritance)**: When unifying components with similar structure, use **composition, not inheritance**. Provide common shell and inject content via Slot (`content: @Composable () -> Unit`)
- **Component Location Rules**: Common components must be in `core` module. Direct dependencies between Feature modules are prohibited, common components must be in `core`
- **Code Structure Improvement Before @Suppress**: When detekt warning occurs, must try code structure improvement before using `@Suppress`. When parameters increase after State Hoisting pattern, group with Event Interface or State Class
- **Required Verification on Structure Changes**: File moves, package changes, class refactoring must follow: pre/post build check, search all usages, batch import path changes
- **Preview + Hilt ViewModel**: To avoid Preview render failure, use a ViewModel contract interface, real ViewModel implements it, screen takes contract with default `hiltViewModel<RealVM>()`, and Preview passes `remember { FakeXxxViewModel() }`. See `.cursor/rules/tech-stack/compose.mdc`.

# Rule File Structure

This project uses `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file structure to separate rules:

- **`.cursor/rules/workflow/git-policy.mdc`**: Git operations and branch management policy (always applied: `alwaysApply: true`)
- **`.cursor/rules/workflow/branch-workflow.mdc`**: Branch work and workflow rules (always applied: `alwaysApply: true`)
- **`.cursor/rules/workflow/api-implementation.mdc`**: API implementation rules
- **`.cursor/rules/workflow/pull-request-review.mdc`**: Pull Request and code review rules
- **`.cursor/rules/workflow/execute-dont-instruct.mdc`**: Execute requested actions instead of only giving instructions
- **`.cursor/rules/workflow/pr-ci-checks.mdc`**: Required checks (commitlint, ktlint, build) before merge
- **`.cursor/rules/tech-stack/architecture.mdc`**: Clean Architecture and layer separation rules
- **`.cursor/rules/tech-stack/compose.mdc`**: Jetpack Compose coding rules and patterns
- **`.cursor/rules/tech-stack/android-kotlin.mdc`**: Android/Kotlin coding conventions and Import rules
- **`.cursor/rules/tech-stack/optimistic-updates.mdc`**: Optimistic Updates pattern
- **`.cursor/rules/quality/code-quality.mdc`**: Code quality, formatting, test rules

Each `.mdc` file uses `globs` pattern so rules are injected only when opening or working on related files.
**Workflow rules (Git, branch) are applied to all files, so set `alwaysApply: true`.**

# General Guidelines

## Basic Principles

3. **Work on Appropriate Branch**
   - See `.cursor/rules/workflow/branch-workflow.mdc` for details

4. **`.cursorrules` File Writing Rules**
   - **Critical Rules Summary Required at Top**: When writing or modifying `.cursorrules` file, must include "⚠️ CRITICAL RULES SUMMARY" section at the top
   - **Summary Structure**:
     * MUST DO: List core rules concisely
     * MUST NOT DO: Clearly mark prohibited items
     * CRITICAL PATTERNS: Important pattern summary
   - **Purpose**: Enable AI to recognize core rules at the beginning of Context Window to prevent rule ignoring or hallucination

5. **Memo of Attempted Solutions**
   - When solving problems, memo attempted methods
   - To avoid repeating same mistakes

7. **Component Preview Required**
   - All component functions must include Preview function with `@Preview` annotation
   - Previews should show various states (selected/not selected, enabled/disabled, etc.)
   - Exception: Internal-only components (`internal` functions) are optional

## Problem Solving & Research Rules

### ⚠️ Critical: Required Verification Procedure on Structure Changes
**When performing structural changes (file moves, package changes, class refactoring), must follow these procedures:**

2. **Search All Usages**: Search all locations where file to move/change is used with `grep` and list them
3. **Batch Import Path Changes**: Change import paths at all usages at once (don't do step by step, understand whole first)
4. **Variable/Function Name Changes**: When changing variable/function names, check all usages with `grep` then change in batch
6. **State/Params Class Moves**: When moving State or Params classes, check import paths of all components using that class
7. **Duplicate Removal**: Before removing duplicate files, check all usages, unify to one, then update all import paths

### Perplexity Prompt Writing Request Rules - Critical
**When user requests Perplexity Prompt:**
- **Provide Prompt Content Only**: Provide only content to paste into prompt, nothing else
- **No Additional Explanation**: Do not include guidance like "paste this prompt into Perplexity" after writing prompt
- **No Code Modification**: Do not modify code simultaneously with prompt writing
- **Format**: Provide prompt as plain text without markdown code blocks (so user can copy-paste immediately)

# ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES RE-CONFIRMATION (File End - Sandwich Technique)

**When reading this file, must re-confirm the core rules above:**

## Highest Priority Rules (Never Ignore)
1. **Git Work Pre-Verification**: Before commit/push command generation, **must first verify** that current branch is not `main`/`develop`
3. **`.cursorrules` Length Management**: If this file exceeds 300 lines, consider splitting or keeping only core rules

## Core Technical Rules
- **ViewModel Injection**: `@HiltViewModel` uses `hiltViewModel()`
- **StateFlow Collection**: Use `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` (never use `collectAsState()`)
- **State Hoisting**: All screen states move to ViewModel
- **Preview Required**: All public Composables must have `@Preview`

## Rule File References
- For detailed rules, refer to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files
- Each file uses `globs` pattern so rules are automatically injected during related work

**Violating the above rules may cause serious problems. Must comply.**
